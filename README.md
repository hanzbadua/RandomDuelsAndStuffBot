# Random Duels And Stuff Bot (for Discord)

Pretty much just [this](https://github.com/hanzbadua/LeagueThemedRPGBot), but with no stupid League theme and without hard-to-implement RPG mechanics such as quests; basically this is just a "for fun" bot that will have both PvE and PvP combat, possibly some sort of stupid lootbox mechanic for funsies, and some sort of investing+idle income system
